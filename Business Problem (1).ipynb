    "Whenever a person searches for a venue in a new city, they’re highly interested in the best places that the city has to offer. The person might want to know how good a given restaurant is or the price range it falls under. This extra information would help decide which venue to choose amongst the many venues in the city. Combining the location of the venues in the city with their price and rating information would surely help visitors in a city make better informed decisions about the places they should visit."

    "**Coimbatore** lies at 11°1′6″N 76°58′21″E in south India at 411 meters (1349 ft) above sea level on the banks of the Noyyal River, in southwestern Tamil Nadu. It covers an area of 642.12 km2 (247.92 sq mi). There are many venues (especially restaurants, hotels and cafes) which can be explored. This project explores various venues in Coimbatore and attributes the data based on user ratings and average price. To explore this information, this project involves the juxtaposition of both the Foursquare API and the Zomato API to fetch complete information of various venues (including name, address, category, rating, and price). Further, a map of the venues with specific color attributes will be plotted to highlight their position, and information about these venues. Such plots imbibe bountiful information in the form of their colored representations and location on the map. This enables any visitor to take a quick glance and decide what place to visit."

    "The target audience for such a project is twofold. Firstly, any person who is visiting Coimbatore, India can use the plots and maps from this project to quickly select places that suit their budget and rating preferences. Secondly, a company can use this information to create a website or a mobile application, which is updated on a regular basis, to allow individuals to the city or even expand same functionality to other places."
